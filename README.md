# Menu_CSharp

## What is it?
This is a basic menu app that allows you to pick three choices, Burger, fries, and a drink. Once you pick these options suboptions will appear giving options for things like adding cheese or the size of the fries. Once you are done click compute cost button do display the order cost.

## What I learned
I learned how to use thigs like checkboxes and radio buttons. I learned how to use them together for them to be able to work with eachother and improve the procces of having options. I learned how to have these interactions be used in code and diffrent ways to implement them.
